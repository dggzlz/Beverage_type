# Project Title
Beverage type

# Description
This project gets input from the user, and depending on the user's choice it will print a result with the beverage type and the state of it. This project is originally a assigment from Intro to Comp. Sc I, and it was meant to assess our understanding of Decisions. However, I have modified the project to add more concepts such as While loops and Exceptions - to deal with user's input so it doesn't cause any errors, and OOP.
